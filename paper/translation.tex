Given $q, q' \in \Pred$ and $p \in \Prog$, we reduce the problem of checking
$\models \hoaretriple{q}{p}{q'}$ to the entailment problem of
polynomial equations over integer variables. The reduction is carried out by
the following three transformations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Program slicing. To improve efficiency, segments of the program $p$
  irrelevant to the post-condition $q'$ are removed by program slicing 
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:slicing}). 
\item Static single assignments. The sliced program is transformed
  into static single assignments. Variables in the pre- and
  post-conditions are renamed accordingly
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:static-single-assignment}).
\item Polynomial equations. Validity of algebraic specifications of
  programs in static single assignements is reduced to the entailment
  of a system of polynomial equations
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:multivariant-polynomial-equations}). 
\end{enumerate}

For each transformation, we give an algorithm and establish the
correctness of the algorithm in \coq. Specifically, a semantics
for our domain specific language and the validity of algebraic
specifications is formalized in \coq. The correctness of
transformations is then certified by the proof assistant \coq.
For program slicing and static single assignments, we
construct machine-checkable proofs for the soundness and completeness
of the two transformations. For polynomial equations, another
\coq-certified proof shows the soundness of the transformation
from the validity of the algebraic specification to the entailment of 
a system of polynomial equations. In the following subsections,
transformations and their correctness are elaborated in details.

Given $q, q' \in \Pred$ and $p \in \Prog$, we reduce the problem of checking
$\models \hoaretriple{q}{p}{q'}$ to the entailment problem of modular
polynomial equations over integer variables. The reduction is carried out by
the following three transformations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Program slicing. To improve efficiency, fragments of the program $p$
  irrelevant to the post-condition $q'$ are removed by program slicing 
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:slicing}). 
\item Static single assignments. The sliced program is transformed
  into static single assignments. Variables in pre- and
  post-conditions are also renamed
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:static-single-assignment}).
\item Modular polynomial equations. Validity of algebraic specifications
  is reduced to the entailment of modular polynomial equations
  (Section~\ref{subsection:translation:multivariant-polynomial-equations}). 
\end{enumerate}

For each transformation, we give an algorithm and establish the
correctness of the algorithm in \coq. Specifically, semantics
for our domain specific language and validity of algebraic
specifications are formalized. The correctness of
transformations is then certified by the proof assistant \coq.
For program slicing and static single assignments, we
construct machine-checkable proofs for the soundness and completeness
of the two transformations. For modular polynomial equations, another
\coq-certified proof shows the soundness of the transformation
from the validity of the algebraic specification to the entailment of 
modular polynomial equations. In the following subsections,
transformations and their correctness are elaborated in details.

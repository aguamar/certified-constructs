We show how to solve a range problem, check if a program is safe, and solve modular polynomial equation
entailment problem in this section.
The first two problems are reduced to QF\_BV formulas and solved by an SMT solver.
The last problem is reduced to an ideal membership problem and solve by the computer algebra system \singular.

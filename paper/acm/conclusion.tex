We have developed techniques to verify algebraic and range specifications of
low-level mathematical constructs in cryptographic programs. Our case
studies on real low-level implementations of X25519 suggest the
applicability and scalability of our techniques.
%Currently, we are working on techniques that can certify the results of range checks.
Currently, we are working on automatic translation from assembly languages to our domain specific language.
%Future work includes an assembly language with formal semantics formalized in \coq, a certified assembler for the %language, a certified translation from the language to \bvdsl, and application of our techniques to more low-level %mathematical constructs in real cryptographic programs.
We also plan to apply our techniques to more low-level mathematical constructs in real
cryptographic programs.

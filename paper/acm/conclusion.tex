We have developed techniques to verify algebraic and range specifications of
low-level mathematical constructs in cryptographic programs. Our case
studies on real low-level implementations of X25519 suggest the
applicability and scalability of our techniques. Currently, we are
working on techniques that can certify the results of range checks. We also plan to
apply our techniques to more low-level mathematical constructs in real
cryptographic programs.

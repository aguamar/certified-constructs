We have developed techniques to verify algebraic and range specifications of
low-level mathematical constructs in cryptographic programs. Our case
studies on real low-level implementations of X25519 suggest the
applicability and scalability of our techniques.
%Currently, we are working on techniques that can certify the results of range checks.
Currently, we are working on automatic translation from assembly languages to our domain specific language. Such translation will make our verification techniques more accessible to assembly programmers.
%Future work includes an assembly language with formal semantics formalized in \coq, a certified assembler for the %language, a certified translation from the language to \bvdsl, and application of our techniques to more low-level %mathematical constructs in real cryptographic programs.
We are also applying our techniques to more low-level mathematical constructs in industrial
cryptographic programs. Communication with assembly programmers will further improve the proposed techniques in practice.

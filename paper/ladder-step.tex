Recall that X25519 is based on the Abelian group $\bbfG = (G, \Gplus,
\Gzero)$ induced by the curve Curve25519. As aforementioned, the binary
operation $\Gplus$ requires another sequence of arithmetic computation
over $\bbfGF(\varrho)$. Errors could still be introduced or even
implanted in any sequence of computation proclaimed to implement $\Gplus$.

Let $P \in G$ be a point on Curve25519. We write $[n]P$ for the
$n$-fold addition ${P \Gplus \cdots \Gplus P} \in G$ when $n \in \bbfN$.
In X25519, we want to compute a \emph{point multiplication}, that is,
the point $[n]P$ for given $n$ and $P$. The standard iterative
squaring method computes $[n]P$ by examining each bit of $n$ in 
binary. For each iteration, $[2m]P$ is computed and
added with another $P$ when the current bit is $1$. Although the
method is very efficient, it is not constant-time and hence insecure. 

\hide{
The operation we want is a ``point multiplication'' which is given $n$
and $P$ compute $[n]P$.  The na\"ive way to do this is ``double
and add''.  
\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]  
    \Function{point.multiple}{$m,P$}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
      \State $t\leftarrow P$
      \For{$i=\lfloor \log_2 m \rfloor-1\ \mathbf{downto}\ 1$}
      \State $t\leftarrow [2]T$
      \If{$($ bit $i$ of $n$ in binary $)=1$}
      \State $t\leftarrow t\Gplus P$
      \EndIf
      \EndFor
      \State \Return{$t$}
      \EndFunction
    \end{multicols}
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Observe that given $[n]P$ before step 4, we first compute $[2n]P$
or $[2n+1]P$ by the end of step 7 by first doubling to
$[2n]P$ (step 4), then decide to add $P$ or not depending on a
whether a corresponding bit is 1.  But this is obviously not time
constant.  The obvious next step that we can double
(i.e. compute $[2n]P$), \emph{always add} $P$, then choose one
of the two using conditional moves or equivalents.  This however is
inefficient.  We need something equivalent to steps 4--7 but better.

\label{algorithm:ladderstep}
\end{algorithm}

To have constant execution time, the key idea is to compute \emph{both}
$[2m]P$ and $[2m+1]P$ at each iteration. The Montgomery Ladderstep is
an efficient algorithm computes $[2m]P$ and $[2m+1]P$ from $P$,
$[m]P$, and $[m+1]P$. On Montgomery curves (including Curve25519),
the algorithm uses only $x$ coordinates of the points. Furthermore,
expensive divisions are avoided in the Ladderstep by projective
representations. That is, the algorithm represents $x \Fdiv z$ by the
pair $x : z$ and works with fractions (Algorithm~\ref{algorithm:ladderstep}).

\hide{
Peter Montgomery derived a sequence of computations known
as the Montgomery Ladderstep, to compute both $P_0+P_1$ and $[2]P_0$
simultaneously and efficiently knowing $P_1-P_0$.  The ladderstep can
be achieved only using $x$ coordinates on a set of curves today known as
Montgomery curves, which include Curve25519.  Furthermore, we can
avoid expensive divisions by using projective representations (i.e,
instead of $x$ write $x/z$ and work  with fractions).  

The Ladderstep starts from points $[n]P $ and
$[n+1]P $, to get either $ [2n]P $ and
$[2n+1]P$, or $[2n+1]P$ and $[2n+2]P$, the difference between the two points remaining $\pm P$.  Provided that there is a time-constant way to swap the two input
points, this
is equivalent to computing either $[2n]P$ or $[2n+1]P$
from $[n]P$ in constant
time and is sufficient to compute any $[n]P$ where
$n$ has a known bitlength.  This is known as a differential
addition chain and is one of the fundamental ways to avoid timing
attacks.  For curves not equivalent to a Montgomery curve, a variant
known as the "Co-$Z$ ladder" is available to effect the same
differential addition chain.

Let primed variables denote values of variables after computation.
The Montgomery Ladderstep has the following
specification~\cite{M:87:SPEC}:\footnote{An amusing fact is that when
  we carry out the Ladderstep, we find for ourselves the factor of $4$
  in both the numerator and denominator of the addition formulas,
  noted on \cite[p.~261]{M:87:SPEC}.}
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
  x'_{m} & \Feq & 4 \Ftimes (x_m \Ftimes x_{m+1} \Fminus z_m \Ftimes z_{m+1})
               \Ftimes (x_m \Ftimes x_{m+1} \Fminus z_m \Ftimes z_{m+1}) \\
  z'_{m} & \Feq & 4 \Ftimes x_1 \Ftimes (x_m \Ftimes z_{m+1} \Fminus
               z_m \Ftimes x_{m+1})

  x'_{m+1} & \Feq & (x_m \Ftimes x_m \Fminus z_m \Ftimes z_m) \Ftimes

In our experiment, we replace all arithmetic computation over $\bbfF$
with corrresponding mathematical constructs (8 additions, 2 squares, 7
multiplications, and 1 multiplication by 121666) written in \mydsl,
translate the above specification into an algebraic specification, and
apply our technique to verify the entire Ladderstep (\todo{number of
 statements}). \todo{how much time?}

Montgomery's formulas and his steps are well known
since~\cite{M:87:SPEC}.  What we showed is that the program carrys out
a computation equivalent to his formulas\footnote{An amusing fact is

  in both the numerator and denominator of the addition formulas, 
  noted on \cite[p.~261]{M:87:SPEC}.}.
